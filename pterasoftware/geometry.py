    This class contains the following public methods:
        populate_coordinates: This method populates a variable with the coordinates
        of the airfoil.

        populate_mcl_coordinates: This method creates a list of the airfoil's mean
        camber line coordinates. It also creates two lists of the vectors needed to
        go from the mcl coordinates to the upper and lower surfaces. It also creates
        list of the thicknesses at the x coordinates along the mean camber line.

        leading_edge_index: This method returns the index of the point along the
        leading edge.

        lower_coordinates: This method returns a matrix of x and y coordinates that
        describe the lower surface of the airfoil.

        upper_coordinates: This method returns a matrix of x and y coordinates that
        describe the upper surface of the airfoil.

        get_downsampled_mcl: This method returns the mean camber line in a
        downsampled form.

        get_camber_at_chord_fraction: This method returns the camber of the airfoil
        at a given fraction of the chord.

        repanel_current_airfoil: This method returns a repaneled version of the
        airfoil with cosine-spaced coordinates on the upper and lower surfaces.

        add_control_surface: This method returns a version of the airfoil with a
        control surface added at a given point.

        draw: This method plots this Airfoil's coordinates using PyPlot.
