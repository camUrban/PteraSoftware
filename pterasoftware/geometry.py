    The Airplane class serves as the root coordinate system for the aircraft geometry.
    All coordinate systems are ultimately defined relative to the Airplane's local
    geometry axes, which represent the aircraft's primary reference frame. The Airplane
    class is responsible for:

    1. Defining the local geometry axes as the root coordinate system
    2. Managing Wing objects and their coordinate transformations
    3. Processing symmetric Wing objects and converting them to separate wings when
       the symmetry plane is not coincident with the Wing's XZ plane (Scenario 5)
    4. Providing reference dimensions for aerodynamic calculations
    5. Managing the moment reference point for force and moment calculations

    Local geometry axes convention:
    - +x: Points aft along fuselage
    - +y: Points to the right (starboard direction)
    - +z: Points upward (completing right-handed coordinate system)

    Every wing has its axis system, known as wing axes. The user sets the
    relationship between these axes and geometry axes with the local_position and
    local_rotations parameters. However, the steps for transforming a vector from
    geometry axes to wing axes, and the interpretation of the wing axes orientation
    and position relative to a Wing's geometry, also depend on the parameters
    symmetric, mirror_only, symmetry_plane, and symmetry_point:
        1. symmetric is False
            A. mirror_only is False
                I. The symmetry plane must be undefined (symmetry_plane_normal and
                symmetry_plane_point must be None)
                    Scenario 1:
                    - local_position is the final location of leading edge of this
                    Wing's root WingCrossSection, as defined in geometry axes.
                    - local_position is also the final location of the origin of this
                    Wing's wing axes, as defined in geometry axes.
                    - Translation by local_position followed by rotations by
                    local_rotations fully define this Wing's wing axes with respect
                    to the geometry axes. The wing axes will also retain the
                    handedness of the geometry axes.
            B. mirror_only is True
                I. The symmetry plane is coincident with this Wing's wing axes' xz-plane
                    Scenario 2:
                    - local_position is the final location of leading edge of this
                    Wing's root WingCrossSection, as defined in geometry axes.

                    Wing's wing axes, as defined in geometry axes.
                    - Translation by local_position followed by rotations by
                    local_rotations does not fully define orientation of this Wing's
                    wing axes with respect to the geometry axes. After translation
                    and rotation, the coordinate system also needs to be reflected
                    across the symmetry plane, which will flip the wing axes'
                    handedness to be opposite that of geometry axes.
                II. The symmetry plane is not coincident with this Wing's wing axes'
                xz-plane
                    Scenario 3:
                    - local_position is not final location of leading edge of this
                    Wing's root WingCrossSection, as defined in geometry axes.
                    - local_position is not the final location of the origin of this
                    Wing's wing axes, as defined in geometry axes.
                    - Translation by local_position followed by rotations by
                    local_rotations does not fully define orientation of this Wing's
                    wing axes with respect to the geometry axes. After translation

                    across the symmetry plane, which will flip the wing axes'

        2. symmetric is True
            A. mirror_only must be False
                I. the symmetry plane is coincident with this Wing's wing axes' xz-plane
                    Scenario 4:

                    Wing's root WingCrossSection, as defined in geometry axes.
                    However, while the root WingCrossSection is the still the first
                    item in the wing_cross_sections list, when meshed, panels will
                    extend from the root in both the +y and -y wing axis directions.
                    The length of the wing_cross_sections list remains unchanged.
                    - local_position is also the final location of the origin of this
                    Wing's wing axes, as defined in geometry axes.
                    - Translation by local_position followed by rotations by
                    local_rotations fully define this Wing's wing axes with respect

                xz-plane
                    Scenario 5:
                    - This Wing's Airplane will set this Wing's symmetric parameter
                    to False, its mirror_only parameter to False,
                    its symmetry_plane_normal parameter to None and its
                    symmetry_plane_point parameter to None. These changes turn this
                    Wing into a "Scenario 1 Wing."
                    - The Airplane will also create a new Wing, and add it to its
                    wings list immediately after the current Wing. The new Wing will
                    have the same name as this Wing, but with the prefix "Reflected
                    ". The new Wing also will have all the same parameters as this
                    Wing, except that symmetric will be False and mirror_only will
                    be True, which means that it will be a "Scenario 3 Wing."
                    - Also, if the control_surface_type is "asymmetric" for any of
                    this Wing's WingCrossSections, the reflected Wing's corresponding
                    WingCrossSections will have their control_surface_deflection
                    values multiplied by negative one.

            Note that reversing the normal direction (using the antiparallel vector)

    This class contains the following public methods:
        validate_root_constraints: This method validates constraints specific to
        root WingCrossSection objects.

        validate_tip_constraints: This method validates constraints specific to
        tip WingCrossSection objects.

    This class contains the following class attributes:
        None

    Subclassing:
        This class is not meant to be subclassed.

    The first WingCrossSection in a Wing's wing_cross_section list is known as the
    root WingCrossSection. The last is known as the tip WingCrossSection.

    Every WingCrossSection has its own wing cross section axes. For root
    WingCrossSections, their wing cross section axes are identical in position,
    orientation, and handedness to their Wing's wing axes. For all other
    WingCrossSections, their wing cross section axes are defined relative to the axes
    of the previous WingCrossSection. Locally, the x-axis points from a cross
    section's leading point to its trailing point, the y-axis points spanwise in the
    general direction of the next WingCrossSection, and the z-axis points upwards.

    Things can get a little confusing with respect to WingCrossSections for Wings
    with symmetric or mirror_only set to True. For more details, look in the Wing
    class's docstring. Also remember that WingCrossSections themselves aren't used
    for any simulations, they are merely one of the Wing attributes that help explain
    how to the meshing function how we'd like to generate its Panels.

    This class contains the following public methods:
        populate_coordinates: This method populates a variable with the coordinates
        of the airfoil.

        populate_mcl_coordinates: This method creates a list of the airfoil's mean
        camber line coordinates. It also creates two lists of the vectors needed to
        go from the mcl coordinates to the upper and lower surfaces. It also creates
        list of the thicknesses at the x coordinates along the mean camber line.

        leading_edge_index: This method returns the index of the point along the
        leading edge.

        lower_coordinates: This method returns a matrix of x and y coordinates that
        describe the lower surface of the airfoil.

        upper_coordinates: This method returns a matrix of x and y coordinates that
        describe the upper surface of the airfoil.

        get_downsampled_mcl: This method returns the mean camber line in a
        downsampled form.

        get_camber_at_chord_fraction: This method returns the camber of the airfoil
        at a given fraction of the chord.

        repanel_current_airfoil: This method returns a repaneled version of the
        airfoil with cosine-spaced coordinates on the upper and lower surfaces.

        add_control_surface: This method returns a version of the airfoil with a
        control surface added at a given point.

        draw: This method plots this Airfoil's coordinates using PyPlot.
