This module contains the following exceptions:
    None

This module contains the following functions:
    draw: Draw the geometry of the airplanes in a solver object.

    animate: Create an animation of a problem's movement.

    plot_results_versus_time: This method takes in an unsteady solver object,
    and plots the geometries' forces, moments, force coefficients, and moment
    coefficients as a function of time.

    print_steady_results: This function prints the forces, moments,
    force coefficients, and moment coefficients calculated by a steady solver.

    print_unsteady_results: This function prints the final cycle-averaged of the
    forces, moments, force coefficients, and moment coefficients calculated by an
    unsteady solver.

    get_panel_surfaces: This function returns a PolyData representation of the wing
    panel surfaces associated with all the airplanes in a given list.

    get_wake_ring_vortex_surfaces: This function returns the PolyData object for the
    surface of wake ring vortices at a given time step.

    get_scalars: This function gets the coefficient values from a problem's airplane
    objects, and puts them into a 1D array to be used as scalars for display by other
    output methods.

    plot_scalars: This function plots a scalar bars, the mesh panels with a
    particular set of scalars, and labels for the minimum and maximum scalar values. """
