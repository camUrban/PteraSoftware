    This class contains the following public methods:
        run: Run the solver on the steady problem.

        initialize_panel_vortices: This method calculates the locations of the vortex
        vertices, and then initializes the panels' vortices.

        collapse_geometry: This method converts attributes of the problem's geometry
        into 1D ndarrays. This facilitates vectorization, which speeds up the solver.

        calculate_wing_wing_influences: This method finds the matrix of wing-wing
        influence coefficients associated with this airplane's geometry.

        calculate_vortex_strengths: This method solves for each panel's vortex
        strength.

        calculate_solution_velocity: This function takes in a group of points. At
        every point, it finds the induced velocity due to every vortex and the
        freestream velocity.

        calculate_near_field_forces_and_moments: This method finds the forces and
        moments calculated from the near field.

        calculate_streamlines: This method calculates the location of the streamlines
        coming off the back of the wings.

        operations than using the vortex objects' class methods for calculating
        induced velocity.
