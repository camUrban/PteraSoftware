"""This module is a testing case for the steady horseshoe vortex lattice method solver.

Based on an identical XFLR5 testing case, the expected output for the single-wing case
is:
    CL:     0.790
    CDi:    0.019
    Cm:     -0.690

Based on an identical XFLR5 testing case, the expected output for the multi-wing case
is:
    CL:     0.524
    CDi:    0.007
    Cm:     -0.350

Note: The expected output was created using XFLR5's inviscid VLM1 analysis type,
which is a horseshoe vortex lattice method solver.
