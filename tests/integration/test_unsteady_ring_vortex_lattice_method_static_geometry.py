"""This is a testing case for the unsteady ring vortex lattice method solver with
static geometry.

Based on an equivalent XFLR5 testing case, the expected output for this case is:
    CL:     0.588
    CDi:    0.011
    Cm:     -0.197

Note: The expected output was created using XFLR5's inviscid VLM2 analysis type, which is a ring vortex lattice
method solver. The geometry in this case is static. Therefore, the results of this unsteady solver should converge to
be close to XFLR5's static result.
