"""This script runs a validation case of Ptera Software’s UVLM.

I first emulate the geometry and kinematics of a flapping robotic test stand from
"Experimental and Analytical Pressure Characterization of a Rigid Flapping Wing for
Ornithopter Development" by Derrick Yeo, Ella M. Atkins, and Wei Shyy. Then,
I run the UVLM simulation of an experiment from this paper. Finally, I compare the
simulated results to the published experimental results.

WebPlotDigitizer, by Ankit Rohatgi, was used to extract data from Yeo et al., 2011.

More information can be found in my accompanying report: "Validating an Open-Source
UVLM Solver for Analyzing Flapping Wing Flight: An Experimental Approach."
