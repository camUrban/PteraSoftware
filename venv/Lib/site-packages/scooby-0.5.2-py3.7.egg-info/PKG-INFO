        A Great Dane turned Python environment detective
        
        This is a lightweight toolset to easily report your Python environment's
        package versions and hardware resources.
        
        
        Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scooby/):
        
        ```bash
        pip install scooby
        ```
        
        ![Jupyter Notebook Formatting](https://github.com/banesullivan/scooby/raw/master/assets/jupyter.png)
        
        Scooby has HTML formatting for Jupyter notebooks and rich text formatting for
        just about every other environment. We designed this module to be lightweight
        such that it could easily be added as a dependency to Python projects for
        environment reporting when debugging. Simply add `scooby` to your dependencies
        and implement a function to have `scooby` report on the aspects of the
        environment you care most about.
        
        If `scooby` is unable to detect aspects of an environment that you'd like to
        know, please share this with us as a feature requests or pull requests.
        
        The scooby reporting is derived from the versioning-scripts created by [Dieter
        Werthmüller](https://github.com/prisae) for
        [empymod](https://empymod.github.io), [emg3d](https://empymod.github.io), and
        the [SimPEG](https://github.com/simpeg/) framework. It was heavily inspired by
        `ipynbtools.py` from [qutip](https://github.com/qutip) and
        [`watermark.py`](https://github.com/rasbt/watermark). This package has been
        altered to create a lightweight implementation so that it can easily be used as
        an environment reporting tool in any Python library with minimal impact.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Generating Reports
        
        Reports are rendered as html-tables in Jupyter notebooks as shown in the
        screenshot above, and otherwise as plain text lists. If you do not output the
        report object either at the end of a notebook cell or it is generated
        somewhere in a vanilla Python script, you may have to print the report object:
        `print(scooby.Report())`, but note that this will only output the plain text
        representation of the script.
        
        ```py
        >>> import scooby
        >>> scooby.Report()
        ```
        ```

        ```
        As can be seen, scooby reports if a package could not be imported or if the
        version of a package could not be determined.
        
        Other useful parameters are
        
        - `ncol`: number of columns in the html-table;
        - `text_width`: text width of the plain-text version;
        - `sort`: list is sorted alphabetically if True.
        
        Besides `additional` there are two more lists, `core` and `optional`, which
        can be used to provide package names. However, they are mostly useful for
        package maintainers wanting to use scooby to create their reporting system.
        See below:
        
        
        ### Implementing scooby in your project
        
        You can generate easily your own Report-instance using scooby:
        
        ```py
        class Report(scooby.Report):
            def __init__(self, additional=None, ncol=3, text_width=80, sort=False):
                """Initiate a scooby.Report instance."""
        
                # Mandatory packages.
                core = ['yourpackage', 'your_core_packages', 'e.g.', 'numpy', 'scooby']
        
                # Optional packages.
                optional = ['your_optional_packages', 'e.g.', 'matplotlib']
        
                scooby.Report.__init__(self, additional=additional, core=core,
                                       optional=optional, ncol=ncol,
                                       text_width=text_width, sort=sort)
        ```
        
        So a user can use your Report:
        ```py
        >>> import your_package
        >>> your_package.Report()
        ```
        
        The packages on the `core`-list are the mandatory ones for your project, while
        the `optional`-list can be used for optional packages. Keep the
        `additional`-list free to allow your users to add packages to the list.
        
        ### Implementing as a soft dependency
        
        If you would like to implement `scooby`, but are hesitant to add another
        dependency to your package, here an easy way how you can use `scooby` as a soft
        dependency. Instead of `import scooby` use the following snippet:
        
        ```py
        # Make scooby a soft dependency:
        try:
            from scooby import Report as ScoobyReport
        except ImportError:
            class ScoobyReport:
                def __init__(self, additional, core, optional, ncol, text_width, sort):
                    print('\n  *ERROR*: `Report` requires `scooby`.'
                          '\n           Install it via `pip install scooby` or')
                          '\n           `conda install -c conda-forge scooby`.\n')
        ```
        and then include your own `Report`-function as above,
        
        ```py
        class Report(scooby.Report):
            def __init__(self, additional=None, ncol=3, text_width=80, sort=False):
                """Initiate a scooby.Report instance."""
        
                # Mandatory packages.
                core = ['yourpackage', 'your_core_packages', 'e.g.', 'numpy', 'scooby']
        
                # Optional packages.
                optional = ['your_optional_packages', 'e.g.', 'matplotlib']
        
                scooby.Report.__init__(self, additional=additional, core=core,
                                       optional=optional, ncol=ncol,
                                       text_width=text_width, sort=sort)
        
        ```
        If a user has `scooby` installed, all works as expected. If `scooby` is not
        installed, it will just print the following message:
        
        ```py
        >>> import your_package
        >>> your_package.Report()
        
          *ERROR*: `Report` requires `scooby`
                   Install it via `pip install scooby` or
                   `conda install -c conda-forge scooby`.
        ```
        
        ### Solving Mysteries
        
        Are you struggling with the mystery of whether or not code is being executed in
        IPython, Jupyter, or normal Python? Try using some of Scooby's investigative
        functions to solve these kinds of mysteries:
        
        ```py
        import scooby
        
        if scooby.in_ipykernel():
            # Do Jupyter/IPyKernel stuff
        elif scooby.in_ipython():
            # Do IPython stuff
        else:
            # Do normal, boring Python stuff
        ```
        
        ### How does scooby gets the version number?
        
        A couple of locations are checked, and we are happy to implement more if
        needed, just open an issue!
        
        Currently, it looks in the following places:
        - `__version__`;
        - `version`;
        - lookup `VERSION_ATTRIBUTES`;
        - lookup `VERSION_METHODS`.
        
        `VERSION_ATTRIBUTES` is a dictionary of attributes for known python packages
        with a non-standard place for the version, e.g. `VERSION_ATTRIBUTES['vtk'] =
        'VTK_VERSION'`. You can add other known places via
        ```py
        scooby.knowledge.VERSION_ATTRIBUTES['a_module'] = 'Awesom_version_location'
        ```
        
        Similarly, `VERSION_METHODS` is a dictionary for methods to find the version,
        and you can add similarly your methods which will define the version of a
        package.
        
        ### Using scooby to get version information.
        
        If you are just interested in the version of a package then you can use scooby
        as well. A few examples:
        
        ```py
        >>> import scooby, numpy
        >>> scooby.get_version(numpy)
        ('numpy', '1.16.4')
        >>> scooby.get_version('no_version')
        ('no_version', 'Version unknown')
        >>> scooby.get_version('does_not_exist')
        ('does_not_exist', 'Could not import')
        ```
        Again, modules can be provided as already loaded ones or as string.
        
        
        ### Tracking Imports in a Session
        
        Scooby has the ability to track all imported modules during a Python session
        such that *any* imported, non-standard lib package that is used in the session
        is reported by a `TrackedReport`. For instance, start a session by importing
        Scooby and enabling tracking with the `track_imports()` function.
        Then *all* subsequent packages that are imported during the session will be
        tracked and Scooby can report their versions.
        Once you are ready to generate a report, instantiate a `TrackedReport` object.
        
        In the following example, we import a constant from `scipy` which will report
        the versions of `scipy` and `numpy` as both packages are loaded in the session
        (note that `numpy` is internally loaded by `scipy`).
        
        ```py
        >>> import scooby
        >>> scooby.track_imports()
        
        >>> from scipy.constants import mu_0 # a float value
        
        >>> scooby.TrackedReport()
        ```
        ```
